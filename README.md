# Design-of-4-bit-Servo-Tracking-type-ADC

#Abstract

A 4-bit servo tracking analog to digital converter is designed which can convert analog signal of amplitude ranging between 0 to 8 V. The input voltage VCC of the designed circuit is 9V. For powering flip-flops in counter circuit, 9 V is step down to 5 V using voltage regulator. 4-bit synchronous up down counter is designed using J-K flip flop and logic circuits. The 4-bit digital input is converted to analog output using R-2R ladder type DAC. 555 timer astable multivibrator circuit generates the clock pulses for counter circuit.
